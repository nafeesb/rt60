=============
The purpose of this project is to try to implement a ray tracer in 60 minutes. Why? I was trying to teach some new developers how to get started on complicated problems, and to learn the balance between hacking code, and writing something that can last. I wrote some slides for this "lesson"."

The inspiration came from Pete Shirley's most excellent "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book.
